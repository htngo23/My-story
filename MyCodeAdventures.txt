My name is Huy
And this is my story.. njoy

I play soccer for 20 years then one day I got sick and had to miss a game.  My coach cut me and now I have to become a computer engineer which is what 
my father intented for me.  On the drive home from getting cut, I was miserable...

My favorite food is chicken and pasta... but bacon is great too.  Growing up on a farm, I loved many of the farm animals and I felt bad slaughtering them.  Luckily, they were tasty.
